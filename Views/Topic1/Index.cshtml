    <p>
       There are many forms of Broken Access Control, but most of the issues are based on the assumption that the data will be of certain type (int, string, decimal) and blindly accepting them from your visitors. Another issues in this area is verifying access and testing access to your application, specifically looking at it from an attacker's perspective.
