# DVWA-CSHARP
Damn Vunernable Web App - C#, .NET

Yet another DVWA for C#, updated for OWASP Top 10 - 2021. 
Ideally, this application uses InProc EntityFramework and self contained files to prevent the need for restoring to original after the system has been hacked.

Looking at other DVWA's for C#, i felt like it could be gamified and relate to something a larger audience.

## The Scenario
You part of a development and pentest team called Oscorp Bank, set in the MCU Universe. You have managers that have unrealistic timelines and rush everything to production.

Many of the contributing developers are junior level forced to work with little to no oversight and without any peer or code reviews.

Your task is to research vulnerabilities and provide a detailed analysis of your findings, before someone takes advantage.
